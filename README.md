## Skyrim Alchemy Booklet

Skyrim-Alchemy-Booklet is a simple offline search engine tailored for searching
Skyrim's alchemy ingredients. It is also capable of storing custom ingredients
for those with a modded playstyle.

### Documentation[^1]

Opening the app presents you the front page of the application. Here is where
you can *search* an ingredient and see their results below.

The results below the search bar is divided into 5 tabs: **Ingredient Details**
; **Primary Effect**; **Secondary Effect**; **Tertiary Effect**; and
**Quaternary Effect**. The **Ingredients Details** tab is where you can find
related data of the searched ingredient. The other four **Effect** tabs
*changes* their name based on what the *four effects* of the searched
ingredient is. Each of these tabs contains ingredient names with the *same
effect* as their respective tab's name. This is for an easy way to know the
other ingredients that has the same effect as the searched one.

Adding a *Custom Ingredient* stores it inside the app's database, therefore one
can search that ingredient at the front page. Adding a *Custom Ingredient* can
be done at the **Ingredients Database** page found by going to the "*menu*"
button then selecting "*Manage Ingredients*".

A *Custom Ingredient Entry* is composed of 8 parts:
**Name** is the custom ingredient's name;
**Value** is the value of the custom ingredient;
**Weight** is the weight of the custom ingredient;
**Obtained** is the description where the custom ingredient can be found at;
**Primary Effect** is the *Primary Effect* of the custom ingredient;
**Secondary Effect** is the *Secondary Effect* of the custom ingredient;
**Tertiary Effect** is the *Tertiary Effect* of the custom ingredient;
**Quaternary Effect** is the *Quaternary Effect* of the custom ingredient.

When adding an ingredient to the database, an error message stating "Adding
Failed" may appear when either one of these entries are empty or does not
comply with the app's data convention. More details as to why it failed will
be found below the error message. If there are no errors with the entries then
a pop up will appear summarizing the entry for review and confirmation to add
it to the database. Once confirmed any *custom effect* that's been added with
the entry can now be found at the *effects* selection area in any of the four
dropdown boxes. The ingredient will now be part of the database and will now
appear as a search suggestion when searching for it at the front page. 

Removing a *Custom Ingredient Entry* can be done at the "*Manage Ingredients*"
page . Each *custom ingredient entry* has a remove button beside them inside
the page. Clicking so will cause a pop up confirmation that prompts the user
if they wish to remove the selected entry. *Custom ingredients* can be found
at the bottom of the page sorted in alphabetical order.

### Dev Notes
This application is a personal project of mine meant to improve my development
skills. This project has been a steep learning curve evident by the
repository's commit history . But this project indeed has been a great
sharpening stone as well as entertaining despite the challenges I had faced. I
hope this project can showcase to you my skills as an aspiring developer. And I
hope this little project can serve people who found this app because of the
game Skyrim.
